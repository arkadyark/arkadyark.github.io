    <h1 class="post-title">About me</h1>
    <p> My name is Arkady ('R-kah-dee') Arkhangorodsky (nope). I'm a student in my first year of Engineering Science at the University of Toronto, interested in programming, music, history, people, robots, and a whole lot more. I like to play piano when I get the chance.

    On this site you'll find my thoughts, projects, interests and more. I like to think that I have a lot of them.

    I'm mostly using this as a sandbox to pick up some web development skills, so things will be changing here pretty constantly.</p>
