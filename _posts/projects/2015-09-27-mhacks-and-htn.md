A couple more hackathons to kick off the year :) These two were also ones that I'd missed out on last year, namely MHacks and Hack the North. One nice thing at these was that my roommate and good friend [Kasra Koushan](http://kkoushan.com/) came out, and they were his first two. I've been told quite a few times by multiple people about the joys of being the one to introduce people to hackathons, and I definitely felt that. So here's what I got up to for the two weekends:

### MHacks - [glas4](http://glas4.co)
MHacks was pretty cool. First there was the obligatory longer-than-predicted bus ride, not getting there until 7pm or so after leaving at noon. After that Kasra and I grabbed some food and sat down to start doing a bit of brainstorming for what to do. Out of nowhere, a guy (Dev Chakraborty) came up to us and asked if we had a team, idea, and would we let him join. So then we were three. Later on, in the opening ceremonies, I ran into a friend I'd made on the way back to the airport from Hack the Planet this summer, Sharon Roy. Now, with a proper team, we just needed an idea.

Then we had some frustrations. What followed for about 5ish hours was some of the most intense "creative block" I'd ever experienced. We sat at a table trying to come up with something. For a time it almost felt like we'd just go on like this, unable to come up with anything, for the entire 36 hours. Fortunately that didn't happen, right as we were about to sleep we came up with something and solidified it in the early hours of the next day.

We decided to make what we called 'glas4' (glas coming from doing some Google Translates of words like 'vote', 'democracy', 'freedom' to Eastern European languages (I think in the end we chose 'vote' in Croatian), 4 coming from there being 4 of us). The basic idea was that it would take videos of top political candidates, and isolate the specific bits where they're identified as speaking on a specific issue. In theory this would turn informing oneself, at least at a basic level, from a several hour process to a few minute process. We used some React (mostly Dev), Parse (mostly Sharon), and Python (mostly Kasra and I) to scrape it together.

Turned out people actually liked it, and we won a prize! Awesome for Kasra at his first hackathon, a very different experience from my first where we never submitted anything.

### Hack the North - ???
The next weekend was a bit different. First of all it was in Waterloo, which meant a two hour bus ride rather than the 8-12 hours that I'd been used to. That weekend I was feeling really out of it (for multiple reasons, which I don't want to get into here) and also wanted to try something different, working by myself for a change. I'd always worked in teams and felt confident enough in my own abilities that I could pull something off on my own. Though I didn't end up making anything, mostly because I was a bit ambitious and tried to play with game development and the Unreal Engine (which my poor Macbook Air could NOT handle), I still feel that I could pull something off on my own.

Huge huge praise is deserved by the Hack the North team, who ran the thing incredibly well. Everything was just so tight, quick food lines and hundreds of volunteers actually working efficiently, a really inspirational opening ceremony, clean and timely awards. Good stuff.

### Up next
Next up looks to be YHack, which should be fun because my sister will also be there! And also Yale. Looking forward to it.
