I haven't written anything here in a bit but now that I've spent 25 bucks to renew
the domain name for another year. I'm sitting on the bus back from Philadelphia where
I was hacking at PennApps this weekend. Really fun time with some nice poetic
circularity at being back in the same spot as a year ago, and repeating some of the
same things, while changing up some others. It was nice working/smashing with Rohit,
Harry and Ashish. 'Snowzilla', as they called it, provided a nice backdrop.

Hackathons feel like (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_tank)[floating] in how
they help me to cleanse my thoughts and get things straight in my head. I don't think
that's the reason that I can't seem to stop attending them,  but it's a nice perk. The
environment at hackathons is often dreamlike, in the sense that things seem to just flow,
and things that in the normal world would look out of place fit right in without
question. That, together with the long periods of intense focus and lack of sleep,
and often super long bus rides that allow for a long post-mortem thinking session afterwards,
creates a mental environment that is ripe for deeper thinking.

This time I've been thinking a lot about my own development. Naturally, since I'm back
now where it all got started at PennApps a year ago. I've been thinking about being
creative and imaginative, how important that is. I love everything in my life right now.
