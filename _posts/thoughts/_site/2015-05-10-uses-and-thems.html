<p>I’m just settling into Vancouver now for my summer programming internship with <a href="orbisaccess.co.uk">Orbis Access</a>. On Friday we had a corporate soccer league game that was surprisingly intense - my theory is the numerous British people at the company. Needless to say, like just about every soccer game ever, things quite quickly got aggressive and heated. That got me philosophizing (while I was subbed off, of course) about how this seems to happen all the time, practically without fail. I don’t think I’ve ever played in a game where I felt no strong positive emotion towards my teammates, and some negative emotion towards my opponents.</p>

<p>Where this gets weird is when you’re playing multiple games with the same groups of people, and shuffling up the teams so time is spent on the same team as people you were previously opposing. This will be happening with me this Monday, when we play an inter-company kick-around and I’ll be against some of the coworkers from Friday’s game.</p>

<p>This is a more general thing that I’ve seen people do all of the time, and that’s the classification of the world as having an ‘us’ and a ‘them’. Evolutionarily this makes perfect sense, since the uses would be people you’d be spending just about your whole life with, and the thems could be people who wanted to kill you and take everything you own. These groups would switch only pretty rarely (the old custom of a defeated side in a war having to send hostages that were children of higher-ups is an interesting counter-example). This meant that choosing an us quickly and sticking to it passionately was advantageous in the past, but today that instinct is responsible for a whole lot of problems. It appears to me that most of the hatred that people feel towards groups of people comes from this instinct - which in turn leads to all kinds of nasty things like wars and racism.</p>

<p>Just one more case of evolution working against us in our day-to-day lives. It did wonderfully to get us this far, but our innate instincts are a bit out of place now in a world of skyscrapers and international flights.</p>
