Got some inspiration when I'd been lacking some for a while this morning. For a piece of writing for my Engineering and Society course, I had been reading up on Netscape Mosaic and early versions of Internet Explorer. I wanted to actually try running Mosaic on my machine now, so I went and downloaded it. Naturally I went for the oldest version I could find, from 1995. Installation involved building the source, so I have the source code of Mosaic sitting on my computer.

It had been getting a bit stale and sitting around for a week or so when I was cleaning up my downloads folder and looked through it again. From just a cursory first perusal I found a few gems in the comments.

!["Marc = Marc Andreessen"][code-snip]

First just some notes about the code itself: the entire src folder weighs in at under 1MB. That's surprisingly close to the 'weight' of this website, also close to 1MB (makes me feel just a bit inadequate). The entire thing is written in C and is actually quite digestible. I would recommend reading this to a lot of people given it's enormous impact.

What I found inspirational about this whole thing was that in the comments there were things like 'HORRIBLE HACK @@@@' and 'Marc [Andreessen], I imagine you might want to do something cleaner with these?' and 'Sheesh, this is not pretty'. This isn't some hackathon project we're looking at, though, this is frigging Mosaic. If it weren't for Microsoft taking drastic and shady measures, we'd probably still be using this browser, and for a time it commanded a bigger browser market share than Chrome does now. The point I took from this is that it's all hacks, things that can be done cleaner, things that are not pretty. And it doesn't matter. What matters is that it really really worked, and came at the right place and time. From a technical perspective ~3-4 years of programming education would give somebody enough to be able to understand and produce something like this.

What a time to be alive.
