title: Music and expressing oneself

This morning as I was walking to class, more or less out of nowhere the following words appeared in my head:

_Music is the highest form of art_

Whoa. I was kind of taken aback, because I most definitely know enough about neither art forms nor music to make and defend a claim like that. It is, however, a testament to how much I love music.

Here's a statement I can defend:

_I **really** love music_

This has been true for quite a while, more or less since I first started listening to music I found myself. One aspect that I don't think is acknowledged enough about music is that people can express themselves not only through the production of music, but through the music that themselves choose to listen to. I think that this can be an even more powerful form of self-expression than the production of music itself, and here's why. While with making music, you are only really able to express yourself and what constitutes you. This, compared to all of the linear combinations of all of the different artists of past and present, is really nothing. For me personally, I would say with strong conviction that the fact that I listen to and deeply appreciate all of hip-hop, jazz, and classical music says more about me than any music I could possibly produce.

That's all of the time I have for now, but I have a lot more to write on the subject and I plan to do so soon.
