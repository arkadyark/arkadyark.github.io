Something was in the air at the beginning 2012. The previous fall, a Stanford professor by the name of Sebastian Thrun had announced that he would offer an online class on artificial intelligence, for free. To the surprise of Thrun and everybody else involved, 160000 eager students from around the world signed up. To put that in perspective, the entire student body of Stanford (both undergraduate and graduate) is around 16000, ten times less. In response to this, Thrun quit his job and started a company, Udacity, committed to opening up a quality educational experience to students everywhere.

At around the same time, the other major players in the online education game emerged, namely Coursera and EdX (at the time still MITx). Around the same time as that, my mother discovered these classes and shared them with me - one of the greatest things to ever happen to me. In the three years that have since elapsed, I've completed somewhere around 60 online MOOCs (massive open online classes, as these offering came to be called). Educating myself in this way has cost me a grand total of...nothing at all.

I don't think that MOOCs are perfect or the answer to all of the (many) problems with education today. They aren't for everybody, but I do think there are some improvements they offer that can be said to be better than the old (current) system for any student who truly wants to learn.

1. You learn at your own pace
While MOOCs typically still do have schedules (though this is changing and not universal anyways - Udacity adopts an entirely self-paced model), they are only really there on PDF paper, and don't actually mean anything if you're trying to learn. The deadlines are more relaxed and the video recordings and course documents aren't going anywhere. People study at different paces, some pick things up quicker than others, and this is also something highly dependent on the subject. I'm slow to pick up things to do with law - I just failed miserably in my first attempt at an International Law class from Louvain on EdX - but the beauty of this system is that I can spend more time on this and take it again and again to my brain's content.

2. You study when it is convenient for you
Another point pertaining to the massive flexibility advantage that online has over traditional. Currently in school, I'm handed a schedule of when I have to go to lectures and when I'm free and I have little to no freedom to mold this if I want to study certain subjects. This constraint exists entirely due to the limited professor time, which is fully reasonable, but can be avoided if the professor's time is not thrown away but instead recorded and distributed. I have a bad problem of falling asleep almost without fail if it's around 2pm and I'm sitting down. This has little to do with boredom or sleep deprivation, it's just a physiological condition I (and I suspect many others) suffer from. This isn't something that needs to be punished. It's a tragic waste of time for me to go to a lecture when I know I'm likely to fall asleep, but I have no alternative if I want to keep up with administrivia. It goes without saying that students learn better when they're awake and alert.

3. You don't need to be rich to study
This may be a harder thing for supporters of the current system to appreciate. Studying is currently crazy expensive and much potential is wasted because people are unfortunate to be born into circumstances that mean they can't afford a top education. Even if more money is poured into education, the very top professors will always be at a premium. With MOOCs I have been able to take several classes from truly incredible teachers from amazing institutions, paying for which would weigh heavily on my back.

Discovering open online education has been one of the best things to ever happen to me and if this helps share that experience with anybody, I'm happy.
