<p>A while back, at deltaHacks, there was a pretty awesome talk given to us, courtesy of the inimitable <a href="http://www.joelhilchey.com/">Joel Hilchey</a>. He had a lot of cool ideas about ideas - how to have them, how to develop them, etc. One of the things he said stuck a bit, and playing with it in my head more recently I discovered some issues I have with it. One of his ‘hacks’ to coming up with lots of ideas, some of which will be good (presumably), is to <em>focus on what sucks</em>. He’s not the first to give the suggestion, it’s pretty much the most common solution for coming up with start-up/products ideas (<a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/225513">here</a>, <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-do-entrepreneurs-come-up-with-new-startup-ideas">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/work/7-ways-think-great-startup-ideas.html">here</a>)</p>

<p>So I tried that for a while, and have been doing so for a while pretty actively and writing down what I think of. I was definitely having lots of ideas, probably more than ever before. But I was noticing a whole lot of these ideas sucked, or were mediocre at best. A lot of them were hackathon type of stuff, that seem very appealing for a short time but could never be life-changing, a thing that people come back to and keep coming back to.</p>

<p>While this is a great way to come up with lots of ideas, and some mediocre ones that people can appreciate, it isn’t a way to make something really big, really life-changing. Facebook wasn’t a response to ‘connecting to people sucks’, Google wasn’t a response to ‘finding things on the internet sucks’, and Snapchat isn’t a response to ‘sharing pictures with people sucks’. These big ideas (and try thinking of other <em>really</em> big ideas, you’ll find the same) were people thinking in the future, and seeing how the world could be better. There’s a difference there - focusing on today’s problems is bound to be short-sighted, while focusing on the future is how you change people’s lives. I like Paul Graham’s <a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">advice</a> of "Live in the future, then build what’s missing."</p>
