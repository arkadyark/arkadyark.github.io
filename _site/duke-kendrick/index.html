<p>It’s been evident since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZWS6CITutY">Q-Tip’s daddy pointed it out in 1991</a>, there are clear parallels between the history of jazz and the history of hip-hop. I’ve been thinking about this quite a bit, I guess because I’ve been going to listen to so much live jazz lately. Both genres were both seen as abominations early in their history, going very much against what was traditional and in style in their respective times. Both genres are undeniably products of a creative black culture. Both genres thrive and grow from their strong focuses on live performance. But the most fun of the parallels, for me, are the matching up of influential characters in their history. In particular I want to focus on the similarities that can be drawn between Duke Ellington and Kendrick Lamar.</p>

<p>When the Duke came around, he was <em>exactly</em> what jazz needed at the time.</p>
