            <h2>
                The Oracle of Hip-Hop
            </h2>
            <p>
            We all know <a href="https://oracleofbacon.org">The Oracle of Bacon</a> - the game where you try to connect any actor to Kevin Bacon in as few jumps as possible. Similar Oracles have been made for other fields, with things like the Erd≈ës number for mathematicians, or even the <a href="http://static.echonest.com/SixDegreesOfBlackSabbath/index.html"> Black Sabbath number</a>. 
            </p>

            <p>
            I found the Black Sabbath site to be out of date, lacking a visualization, and not hip-hop focused. I thought it would be cool to pull data from RapGenius to show all of the collaborations between famous rappers. A <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0511215.pdf">similar study</a> was performed back in 2006, but it too had no visual component and as we are all well aware, much has changed in the game in 9 years.
            </p>
            <div class="section-divider"></div>

            <h3>What am I looking at right now?</h3>
            <p>
            Every point in this network represents a hip-hop artist. I included some groups (even sometimes together with their constituent members - Outkast is an example of this) if they tended to be listed on RapGenius as the group. Every link between two points represents collaborations between the artists. A thicker link means more collaborations between the pair. Thicker links between two artists will bring them closer together.
            </p>
            <p>
            The 'Collaboration threshold' tunes how many collaborations two artists need to have had together to be linked. Intuitively this parameter controls how 'coarse' the network is: a higher threshold leaves just the strongly linked artists together and shows the bigger picture, while a low threshold shows the small-scale interactions between more artists.
            </p>
            <p>
            Hovering over an artist highlights the shortest path (potentially one of many) between them and the central artist. When a link represents fewer collaborations than the threshold, but still appears on the path to the centre, it is shown as a dotted line.
            </p>
            <div class="section-divider"></div>
            <h3>Major takeaways</h3>
            <h5><a id="wu-tang-header" href="https://youtu.be/INh0FUnCDK4?t=6m16s">The Wu got somethin'</a></h5>
            <p>
            Hip-hop is a genre where membership in groups means a lot. How cohesive the Wu-Tang Clan has been still remains unmatched, 20+ years on. A few more recent groups have come close, but no group has been so large, while still remaining so connected.
            </p>
            <p>
            You can see this by bumping the threshold up higher, to about 10 or so. At this point, every single one of the 10 Wu-Tang members (counting the "Unofficial Tenth" Cappadonna) stays together. No group so large is able to stay so close, and also so balanced.

            <h5>Hip-hop has no centre</h5>
            <p>
            While the '06 study found Snoop Dogg to be the most central artist, my initial guess was that a study in 2015 would find Kanye at the centre.

            <h5>Collaborations are bigger than ever</h5>
            <p>
            In making this I also wanted to be able to see how the prevalence of collaborations in hip-hop has changed throughout its history.

            <h3>Interesting tidbits</h3>
            <h5>Krizz Kaliko and Tech N9ne, <em>damn</em>.</h5>
            <p>
            Cranking the threshold up to 65, and slowly bringing it up past that, you start to witness an epic showdown between Ghostface-Raekwon and Krizz Kaliko-Tech N9ne. Both pairs of artists have done an insane amount of work together. Taking it all the way up, though, Krizz Kaliko and Tech N9ne are the last pair standing, and come in with a whopping 119 collaborations together listed on RapGenius.
            </p>
            <p>
            This is especially impressive when you consider that they were never formally a duo/members of a larger group. Also, for my network I left out producer collaborations, so on every one of the 119 collaborations, both artists contribute vocals. Both artists (Tech N9ne in particular) look like their fanbases continue to steadily grow late in their careers, so this number is probably going to keep on rising even higher.
            </p>
            <h5>Least central artists</h5>
            <p>
            A few artists who tragically died before really making the mark they probably could have.
            Eyedea, Capital STEEZ, Eazy-E.
            Also, Kool Keith, as we probably already knew, is <em>way</em> out there.
