    <article class="post-content">
        <p>About a month ago, my team and I came second at a hackathon at McMaster and won, among other awesome things, a 6 month subscription to an online education/training site, <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a>. Honestly, of the prizes we won that day that was the one I though least of - others included a year long Github plan and a super cool <a href="https://store.spark.io/?product=spark-maker-kit">Spark Core kit</a>.</p>

<p>But now that the subscription finally has been sent to us, it seems like this will probably be the prize I remember best. Since starting, I’ve completed 3 classes (making a simple PHP application, using databases in Python with the peewee library, and introductory Objective-C) and am working on another on introductory CSS. In less than a week, I’ve learned enough to be able to create a whole host of pretty cool things, and am filled with a tremendous excitement about what I’ll be able to do with 6 months of this.</p>

<p>Construal levels. What? In my engineering design class, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3152826/">an interesting paper</a> came up. The main take-away was that what determines how long people procrastinate a task is not really how daunting it seems to be, but how precisely we can think about what needs to be done. I’m finding that this explains why I’d rather spend hours on Treehouse yesterday, rather than spend just a bit of time studying for my Calculus test tomorrow, which promises to be <a href="http://skule.ca/courses/exams/MAT195H1_20141_621398541320mat195_t2_2014_solutions.pdf">quite intense</a>. Treehouse, and online education in general, leverage this to make you want to keep going, rather than put it off. You know exactly what you need to do next, at all times. If education is to be fixed (because it is badly broken), it will have to incorporate more of these amazing results about how we learn.</p>

<p>Treehouse is making me remember all of the things I loved about Coursera and EdX, back in the salad days of high school when I’d take ~10 classes at a time. What you pay for with Treehouse, and you don’t really get with Coursera and EdX, is a guaranteed quality. While I absolutely loved what I was able to study before, part of the reason I would take so many classes was (in a way weirdly reminiscent of astronomically high birth rates in developing countries) that I would expect to drop many of them. This was fine back when I had plenty of time, but now that school has become real I don’t quite have the same time to be so loose. I haven’t yet found a class on Treehouse to be anything less than expertly done and carefully crafted so as to be most engaging. We’ll see if this changes.</p>

<p>I probably wouldn’t have paid for it myself ever, but having Treehouse now makes me respect anew the ‘not 100% free’ model of open online education. Online education has had a massive positive impact on my life and a huge number of others. It absolutely has the power to cause a societal level change, that’s becoming increasingly urgent. This is something I firmly believe.</p>
